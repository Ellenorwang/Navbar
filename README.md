# Navbar
1. I built this responsive navigation menu using React and CSS. It includes a hamburger menu for smaller screens, dropdown menus for subcategories, and smooth animations to make it modern and user-friendly. I used React's useState to manage the menu state and added media queries to ensure the design adapts to different screen sizes. To run it locally, you just need to clone the repository, run npm install to install dependencies, and then npm start to launch the server. I used React and Remixicon for icons as key dependencies. I tested the menu thoroughly for functionality, responsiveness, and browser compatibility, and I plan to improve it further by adding accessibility features and enhancing animations.

2. For enhance user experience, I developed visual and interactive design:
   Buttons and links have increased padding and touch targets, ensuring ease of use on mobile and tablet devices.
   All menu items, including dropdowns, are accessible using the Tab key, allowing users with limited mobility to navigate seamlessly
   The color palette is chosen to provide sufficient contrast, ensuring text remains readable for users with visual impairments.
   The design starts with the smallest screen sizes, scaling up to larger devices using media queries.

3. Used for the hamburger menu icon from RemixIcon.  The simple icons would ensure that the navigation menu is lightweight, responsive, 
   and accessible

4. The CityNews Calgary website has a clean and professional design optimized for delivering news content, such as Sticky Navigation Bar, Dropdown Menus, Clear Fonts and High Contrast.
